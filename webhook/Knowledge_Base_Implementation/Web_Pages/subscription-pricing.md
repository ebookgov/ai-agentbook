## 👋 Meet Your Developer

I'm **Clay**, a former Flagstaff real estate agent from a family of agents. I understand the challenges of small-town real estate—every lead matters, and missing a call can cost thousands.

That's why I created **Avoxa AI**: to ensure you never miss another opportunity.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Limited Availability:** I'm a one-man operation committed to exceptional service. In 2026, I'm adding only **40 new agents** (50 total). The first 20 spots are practically being given away—check if yours is still available!
