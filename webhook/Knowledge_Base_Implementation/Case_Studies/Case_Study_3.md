Case Study 3: 14,678-Call Real Estate Pipeline (2025)
Implementation: Custom voice AI built in-house, processing 4+ months of qualified leads

Scale: Real estate firm testing AI qualification at volume

Workflow:

Lead fills form (budget, timeline, location, property type)

AI calls within minutes

Three-turn conversation: intent capture → BANT discovery → property matching

AI extracts qualification signal: urgency, decision-maker availability, financing status

High-quality leads scheduled same-day; others entered nurture workflows

Results:

Total calls attempted: 14,678

Total conversation time: 17,284 minutes (~2.4 min average call length)

Data captured: Property urgency, possession conditions, budget confirmation

Call completion rate: Not specified, but implies substantial volume successful

Key Insight: Sub-3-minute calls are sufficient for qualification if constrained to discovery questions. The AI didn't need 10-15 minute consultations; 90-120 seconds proved adequate for BANT + property matching.
