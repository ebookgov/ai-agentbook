Case Study 2: Redfin Lead Conversion Lift (2024)
Implementation: Unnamed AI voice agent for inbound buyer inquiries

Scale: National real estate platform, millions of annual inquiries

Workflow:

Buyer calls Redfin property line

AI answers (instead of wait queue)

AI answers FAQ (price, square footage, HOA, listing status, showing availability)

AI qualifies interest level, booking intent

If booking intent high: Offers showing slots, transfers to agent; if low: Emails market insights

Results:

Lead conversion rate improvement: +20% (baseline not specified, but 20% lift typical for speed-to-lead)

Average wait time: Near-zero (vs. 2-5 minute queue baseline)

Call volume handled: Unknown, but platform reported successful scale without proportional agent hiring

Key Insight: The AI didn't replace agents; it filtered the queue. Only prospects with genuine booking intent reached agents, eliminating 30-40% of time-wasting FAQ calls.
