## SPDS & HOA Basics

### Q: What does the SPDS require me to disclose about the HOA?

**A:** The Seller's Property Disclosure Statement asks the seller to disclose if the property is in an HOA, the name of the association, the amount and frequency of HOA assessments, and any known violations, disputes, or litigation. The SPDS is about what the seller knows—it doesn't replace getting official documents from the association.

### Q: Do I have to disclose HOA lawsuits or disputes on the SPDS?

**A:** Yes, sellers must disclose any known litigation involving the HOA that could materially affect the buyer, such as lawsuits between the owner and the association or major claims against the HOA. If a seller hides a known dispute, it can be treated as a failure to disclose a material fact under Arizona law.

### Q: Does the SPDS list all HOA rules and restrictions?

**A:** No, the SPDS does not list or summarize all HOA rules, rental limits, or use restrictions. The buyer must review the current CC&Rs, bylaws, and rules from the association for the full set of restrictions.

### Q: When must the seller give the SPDS to the buyer?

**A:** Under the standard Arizona REALTORS® contract, the seller typically has three days after contract acceptance to deliver the completed SPDS. The buyer then has specific inspection and review periods to raise objections or cancel.

## CC&Rs Delivery & 5-Day Review

### Q: When does the buyer get the CC&Rs and HOA documents?

**A:** For planned communities with 50+ lots, the association must deliver the resale disclosure packet within 10 days after receiving written notice of a pending sale with the buyer's name and address. For smaller communities, the seller provides the same information within 10 days.

### Q: How long does the buyer have to review the HOA documents?

**A:** Under the standard Arizona purchase contract, the buyer has **five days** after receiving the HOA documents to review them. If the buyer disapproves of the CC&Rs or other HOA terms within that 5-day window, they can cancel and keep their earnest money.

### Q: What exactly must be delivered from the HOA for a resale?

**A:** A.R.S. 33-1806 requires:

- Declaration (CC&Rs)
- Bylaws and rules
- Current operating budget
- Statement of regular assessments
- Any unpaid assessments or fees on the unit
- Pending litigation disclosure
- Buyer acknowledgment notice about HOA foreclosure rights

## HOA Document Package Contents

### Q: What is in a typical Arizona HOA resale package?

**A:** The package usually includes:

- CC&Rs, bylaws, articles of incorporation
- Current rules and recent budgets/financial statements
- Reserve study or reserve summary
- Recent meeting minutes
- Assessment statement showing dues and balances
- Insurance summaries
- Pending or proposed special assessments
- Known litigation disclosure
- Fee schedule for transfer/move-in charges

### Q: Does the HOA have to include a reserve study?

**A:** The statute requires information about financial condition and reserves, often through statements and any available reserve study or summary. Many Arizona HOAs include at least a reserve study summary or disclosure of reserve funding level.

### Q: Are meeting minutes part of the HOA disclosure package?

**A:** Many associations provide recent board or membership meeting minutes as part of the resale package so buyers can see issues being discussed. Minutes can reveal anticipated special assessments, rules changes, or ongoing disputes.

### Q: Do buyers receive HOA financial statements?

**A:** Yes, resale packages typically include the current operating budget and recent financial statements so buyers can see income, expenses, and reserve contributions.

## Fees, Transfer Charges & Special Assessments

### Q: What are HOA disclosure and transfer fees in Arizona?

**A:** Arizona law caps fees at:

- **Resale disclosure fee:** $400 max
- **Rush delivery:** Additional $100
- **Transfer fee:** Up to $500 (if recorded in CC&Rs)

These fees are often negotiated in the contract as to whether buyer or seller pays.

### Q: What must be disclosed about HOA assessments?

**A:** The resale statement must show:

- Amount and due dates of regular assessments
- Any unpaid regular or special assessments on the unit
- Any other fees or charges currently due
- Transfer, move-in, and processing fees at closing

### Q: Do special assessments have to be disclosed?

**A:** Yes, the package must disclose any unpaid special assessments on the unit and typically describes any approved or formally proposed special assessments. Board minutes and budget notes often provide extra context.

### Q: Who usually pays the HOA transfer and disclosure fees?

**A:** Arizona law sets caps but not who pays. Local custom varies—many contracts negotiate a split, with sellers often covering disclosure fees and buyers covering transfer fees, but it's not mandatory either way.

## Common Buyer Questions (Voice-Ready Responses)

### Q: What's the monthly HOA fee for this home?

**A:** The monthly HOA fee is set by the association and will show in the resale package as the regular assessment amount and due dates. Your agent or escrow officer can read that exact figure from the HOA resale statement once it's ordered.

### Q: Can I see the CC&Rs before I put in an offer?

**A:** In practice, many buyers review CC&Rs after the offer is accepted because the formal resale package is triggered by a pending sale. Even if you see an early copy, you'll still want to review the official set delivered during escrow—that starts your 5-day review window.

### Q: Are there any special assessments coming up?

**A:** The resale documents must show any special assessments already approved and owed on the unit. To see what might be coming, you should also review recent meeting minutes and budgets for discussion of future projects.

### Q: What are the rental restrictions in this HOA?

**A:** Rental restrictions live in the CC&Rs and rules, not on the SPDS. Look for caps on number of rentals, minimum lease terms, or bans on short-term rentals. The resale packet should include those governing documents.

### Q: Can the HOA stop me from doing short-term rentals like Airbnb?

**A:** Many Arizona HOAs restrict or prohibit short-term rentals through CC&Rs that set minimum lease periods or outright bans on stays under a certain number of days. You must read the current CC&Rs and rental policies in the resale package.

### Q: Will the HOA dues likely go up soon?

**A:** There's no guarantee, but clues include the budget, reserve contributions, and reserve study. Underfunded reserves with big upcoming projects often lead to higher dues or special assessments. Meeting minutes can also reveal discussions about planned increases.

---

## Red Flags for Agents to Surface

### Q: Why are underfunded reserves a red flag?

**A:** Underfunded reserves mean the association hasn't saved enough for major future repairs like roofs, paving, and building systems. This increases the risk of large special assessments.

**Voice Script:** *"This HOA's reserves look thin, so you could see higher dues or a one-time special assessment for big projects."*

### Q: How can I tell if an HOA's reserves are underfunded?

**A:** Compare the reserve study's recommended balance and funding plan with the actual reserve account balance and contributions in the financials. Chronic shortfalls or deferred projects are clear warning signs.

### Q: Why is pending litigation a concern for buyers?

**A:** Pending lawsuits can lead to unexpected legal expenses, higher insurance costs, special assessments, or lower lender confidence. A.R.S. 33-1806 requires disclosure of pending litigation so buyers can evaluate that risk.

### Q: What types of HOA litigation should buyers ask about?

**A:** Ask about:

- Construction defect claims
- Disputes with developers
- Insurance coverage fights
- Fair housing/discrimination claims
- Major collection or foreclosure actions

The resale statement typically includes case names and numbers for pending matters.

### Q: Why are rental caps a red flag for some buyers?

**A:** Rental caps limit how many homes can be rented at once and can restrict your future ability to lease your property—affecting flexibility and resale value.

**Voice Script:** *"This HOA has rental caps and strict leasing rules, so if you think you might want to rent this home later, we should go through those sections of the CC&Rs together before you commit."*
