## Solar Ownership vs. Lease

### Q: What transfers to the buyer with owned solar panels?

**A:** The solar system and all associated equipment transfer as real property with the home sale. The buyer receives full ownership benefits including energy savings, tax incentives, and increased home value without additional obligations.

### Q: What are the requirements for assuming a solar lease?

**A:** Buyers must undergo credit qualification separate from mortgage approval, typically requiring a minimum 650 credit score. The transfer process includes signing assumption documents, paying transfer fees ($0-$500), and providing proof of ownership after closing.

### Q: How do Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) affect home sales?

**A:** PPAs function similarly to leases—buyers must assume payment obligations for power purchased and undergo credit approval. The buyer agrees to purchase electricity generated by the system at predetermined rates for the contract term.

### Q: Do leased solar panels add home value?

**A:** Leased systems typically add **zero value** and may complicate sales by limiting buyer pool and affecting debt-to-income ratios during qualification.

## Net Metering: APS vs. SRP

### Q: Does APS offer net metering?

**A:** No. APS uses net billing with the Resource Comparison Proxy (RCP) Export Rate, compensating excess solar energy at approximately **$0.068-0.076/kWh**—about half the retail rate. Systems installed before 2018 may be grandfathered under previous net metering rules.

### Q: What is SRP's solar compensation structure?

**A:** SRP offers solar-specific rate plans with time-of-use pricing and demand charges:

- Export credits: 2.81¢/kWh on Time-of-Use Export plans
- Higher rates on Customer Generation plans
- Demand charges: **$8.40/kW** based on highest on-peak usage

### Q: Can new solar installations get full net metering?

**A:** No. Arizona ended full net metering for new installations after 2018. Current systems receive reduced export rates through either APS's RCP or SRP's net billing structures.

## Common Buyer Questions (Voice-Ready)

### Q: Is the solar owned or leased?

**A:** This is the first critical question. Owned systems transfer outright; leased systems require credit approval and lease assumption. Check the purchase contract and look for UCC-1 filings indicating a lease or loan.

### Q: What are typical electricity bills with solar?

**A:** Bills depend on system size, usage patterns, and utility rate plan. With APS's RCP, homeowners pay retail rates for grid power but receive only ~$0.07/kWh for exports. SRP customers on demand plans may see charges of $8.40/kW based on peak usage plus energy rates.

### Q: Will I have to assume the solar lease?

**A:** Yes, unless the seller pays off the remaining balance. The buyer must qualify independently from mortgage approval, and qualification is not guaranteed even with sufficient income.

### Q: What is the buyout amount for a leased system?

**A:** Buyout amounts vary by lease terms and remaining contract length. Sellers may need to pay off the system to facilitate sale if buyers cannot qualify or refuse assumption.

## Seller Solar Lease Disclosure Requirements

### Q: What documents must sellers provide?

**A:** Sellers must deliver the complete lease agreement, payment history, maintenance records, and all solar system documentation within **three days** after contract acceptance. The lease agreement itself must be attached to the purchase contract.

### Q: What specific information about the lease must be disclosed?

**A:** Sellers must disclose:

- Leasing company name and contact information
- Monthly payment amounts
- Remaining contract term
- Transfer fees (typically $0-$500)
- Whether the system is leased or subject to an unpaid loan

### Q: Is there a specific form for solar disclosures?

**A:** Yes. Arizona REALTORS® must use the **Solar Addendum** form, which creates a contingency period allowing buyers to review lease terms and obtain written approval from the solar company at least three days before closing.

### Legal Framework

### Q: What Arizona laws require solar lease disclosure?

**A:** **ARS 44-1763** and **ARS 33-422** require sellers to disclose material facts about solar energy devices, including lease information. The law applies to all residential real estate transactions involving financed, leased, or third-party-owned solar systems.

### Q: What happens if a seller fails to disclose a solar lease?

**A:** Buyers are likely not obligated to make lease payments for undisclosed solar panels. The seller remains responsible for the lease payments, and the buyer may own the panels free and clear if no UCC filing was recorded.

### Q: When must the disclosure be made?

**A:** Initial disclosure must occur within **three days** after contract acceptance, with final lease assumption approval required at least **three days prior to closing**. This gives buyers time to investigate the lease terms and qualify with the solar company.

## Disclosure Requirements

### Q: When must solar obligations be disclosed?

**A:** Arizona law requires disclosure of solar leases and PPAs during the home sale process. The Arizona REALTORS® provides a Solar Lease/PPA Addendum making buyer obligations contingent upon receiving assumption approval at least three days before closing.

### Q: What are UCC filings on leased systems?

**A:** Solar companies file UCC-1 financing statements with the Arizona Secretary of State to establish their security interest in the solar equipment. These public records appear in title searches and indicate the system is leased or financed rather than owned.

### Q: How do UCC filings affect the sale?

**A:** UCC filings alert buyers and lenders that third-party equipment is installed. The lien attaches to solar panels and related equipment—not the entire home—but must be addressed through lease assumption or payoff before closing.

## Searching Title Records for Solar Liens

### Quick Voice Answer

**Q: How do I check if there's a solar lease lien on an Arizona property?**

**A:** First, search the county recorder's site (like Maricopa County Recorder) by owner name or property address for any recorded UCC, lien, or solar-related documents. Second, search the Arizona Secretary of State UCC database by the owner's name to find any UCC-1 filings from solar or finance companies.

### Step 1: Search County Title Records

**Q: How do I start a search on an Arizona county recorder's website?**

**A:** Navigate to the county recorder's official site (e.g., recorder.maricopa.gov for Maricopa County) and click the "Document Search" or "Recorded Documents" link, then enter the property owner's name, address, or legal description into the search fields.

#### Online Search Process (Step-by-Step)

1. **Open the recorder's search portal**
   - Go to the county recorder's website (Maricopa: <https://recorder.maricopa.gov/recording/document-search.html>)
   - Most Arizona counties provide a similar "Recorded Documents" or "Document Search" page

2. **Choose your search type**
   - Select search by Name, Address, or Legal Description
   - For solar lien checks, searching by owner's name is usually most effective

3. **Enter search criteria**
   - Type the full name of the current owner (as it appears on the deed) or property address
   - Use partial names if unsure of spelling; the system supports wildcard matching

4. **Review the results list**
   - Results show document type, recording date, and parties involved
   - Look for entries labeled UCC, UCC-1, Fixture Filing, or documents recorded by solar finance companies

5. **Open the document details**
   - Click any document to view summary or preview (unofficial copies are free to view)
   - Check collateral description for "solar panels," "photovoltaic system," or equipment lists

6. **Download or purchase official copies (if needed)**
   - Official copies: $1.00/page
   - Certified copies: +$3.00/document
   - Title companies usually obtain certified copies directly

#### In-Person Search Alternative

**Q: Can I search records in person?**

**A:** Yes. Visit the county recorder's office during business hours:

- **Maricopa County:** 1111 W. Washington St., Phoenix
- **Hours:** Monday–Friday, 8:00 AM–5:00 PM

#### Search Tips

- **Use multiple search terms:** Try owner name, property address, AND parcel number
- **Check both filing types:** Solar companies may file UCC-1 in county (fixture filing) OR only with Secretary of State
- **Search 2+ years back:** Maricopa online indexes ~2 years; older records may need manual search

**Implementation:**

```python
def search_county_records(owner_name: str, county: str):
    if county.lower() == "maricopa":
        resp = requests.get(
            "https://your-county-adapter/api/maricopa/search",
            params={"owner": owner_name},
            timeout=0.2  # 200ms budget
        )
        return resp.json()  # normalized list of documents
```

**Latency:** 100-200ms per lookup if cached by county

### Step 2: Search Arizona Secretary of State UCC Database

**Q: How do I check for UCC-1 solar liens at the state level?**

**A:** Use the Arizona Secretary of State's UCC search portal and run a UCC search by debtor name—the homeowner's legal name. Review results for UCC-1 filings listing solar providers or finance companies with collateral such as "solar panels, inverters, and related equipment."

**What to look for:**

- Creditor names matching known solar companies
- Collateral description referencing "photovoltaic panels" or "solar energy system"
- These indicate the lien is tied to the solar system, not the entire home

**Implementation:**

```python
def search_ucc_liens(owner_name: str):
    resp = requests.get(
        "https://your-kyb-provider.com/api/az/ucc",
        params={"debtor_name": owner_name},
        timeout=0.25  # 250ms budget
    )
    liens = resp.json().get("liens", [])
    # Filter likely-solar liens
    solar_liens = [
        l for l in liens
        if "solar" in (l.get("collateral_description", "").lower()
                       + l.get("secured_party_name", "").lower())
    ]
    return solar_liens
```

**Latency:** 150-250ms per query

### Step 3: Interpret Results

**Q: How do I tell if a lien is solar-related and affects the sale?**

**A:**

- **Standard UCC-1** (filed with Secretary of State): Covers panels as personal property; may not appear in county title searches but lenders still require release
- **Fixture filing UCC-1** (recorded in county): Uses property's legal description; shows up in normal title search; panels treated as fixtures

### Voice Agent Pattern (Parallel Lookups)

```python
async def check_solar_liens(owner_name: str, address: str, county: str):
    # Parallel queries to stay within latency budget
    county_task = asyncio.create_task(search_county_records(owner_name, county))
    ucc_task = asyncio.create_task(search_ucc_liens(owner_name))
    
    county_results, ucc_results = await asyncio.gather(county_task, ucc_task)
    
    return {
        "county_liens": county_results,
        "ucc_liens": ucc_results,
        "total_latency_ms": 200-350  # parallel execution
    }
```

**Voice Script:** *"I see 1 active UCC filing from [SolarCo] on your solar equipment filed in [year]. This is a lien on the panels, not the whole house, but your title company will likely require a release or lease transfer before closing."*

## Voice Agent Scripts

### Owned Solar

*"Great news—the solar system is owned outright, so it transfers to you with the home. You'll get the energy savings and any remaining tax benefits without assuming any extra payments."*

### Leased Solar

*"The solar on this property is leased, which means you'd need to qualify to assume the lease separately from your mortgage. The leasing company typically requires a 650+ credit score. Would you like me to explain the buyout option?"*

### APS Rate Explanation

*"This home is on APS, which uses net billing. You'll pay retail rates for any power you pull from the grid, but only get about 7 cents per kilowatt-hour for excess solar you send back. Systems installed before 2018 may have better grandfathered rates."*

### SRP Rate Explanation

*"This home is on SRP, which has demand charges. Your bill includes a charge based on your highest usage during peak hours—currently about $8.40 per kilowatt. The solar helps, but you'll want to avoid big power draws during afternoons."*
