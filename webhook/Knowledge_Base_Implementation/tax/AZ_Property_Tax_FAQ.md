## Tax Structure Fundamentals

### Q: What is Full Cash Value (FCV)?

**A:** Full Cash Value is the market value of your property as determined by the County Assessor. It represents what your home would likely sell for on the open market. The County Assessor updates this value annually based on comparable sales and market conditions.

```json
{
  "topic": "Property Tax",
  "question": "What is Full Cash Value?",
  "answer": "Full Cash Value is your property's estimated market value as determined by the County Assessor. It's based on what comparable homes in your area have sold for recently.",
  "source": "Arizona Department of Revenue",
  "last_updated": "2026-01",
  "voice_ready": true
}
```

### Q: What is Limited Property Value (LPV)?

**A:** Limited Property Value is the value used to calculate your primary property taxes. Unlike Full Cash Value, LPV is capped by law—it can only increase by 5% per year or the percentage increase in Full Cash Value, whichever is less. This protects homeowners from sudden tax spikes when property values rise quickly.

```json
{
  "topic": "Property Tax",
  "question": "What is Limited Property Value?",
  "answer": "Limited Property Value, or LPV, is the capped value used to calculate your main property taxes. Thanks to Proposition 117, your LPV can only go up by 5% per year maximum, even if market values jump higher. This protects you from big tax increases.",
  "source": "Arizona Constitution, Proposition 117",
  "last_updated": "2026-01",
  "voice_ready": true
}
```

### Q: What is Proposition 117 and how does it affect my taxes?

**A:** Proposition 117, passed by Arizona voters in 2012, caps how fast your Limited Property Value can increase. Your LPV can only rise by 5% annually, regardless of how much property values in your area increase. This means even if home prices jump 20% in a year, your primary tax assessment won't increase by more than 5%.

```json
{
  "topic": "Property Tax",
  "question": "What is Proposition 117?",
  "answer": "Proposition 117 is voter-approved protection that caps your property's taxable value increase at 5% per year. Even if the market value shoots up 20%, your primary taxes can only go up by 5% annually. This has saved Arizona homeowners a lot of money in rising markets.",

### Q: What's the difference between primary and secondary taxes?

**A:**

- **Primary Taxes** fund general government operations like school districts, cities, and counties.
- **Secondary Taxes** fund voter-approved bonds, budget overrides, and special districts.
- **Key Change:** Since Proposition 117, **both** primary and secondary taxes are calculated based on the **Limited Property Value (LPV)** for most properties. This means the 5% cap protection applies to your entire tax bill.

```json
{
  "topic": "Property Tax",
  "question": "What's the difference between primary and secondary taxes?",
  "answer": "Primary taxes fund general services like schools and safety, while secondary taxes pay for bonds and special districts. The important thing is that both are now calculated using your Limited Property Value, which is capped. So your entire tax bill benefits from the 5% limit on value increases.",

## Common Buyer Questions

### Q: What are the property taxes on this home?

**A:** Property taxes depend on the assessed value and your specific tax rates. In Arizona, the assessment ratio for residential property is 10% of the Limited Property Value. Your actual tax is calculated by multiplying this assessed value by your combined tax rate. I can look up the specific taxes for any property you're interested in—they're public record with the County Assessor.

```json
{
  "topic": "Property Tax",
  "question": "What are the property taxes?",
  "answer": "Property taxes vary by location and home value. In Arizona, you're taxed on 10% of your Limited Property Value. For a $400,000 home, the assessed value would be about $40,000. At a typical combined rate of $10 per $100 of assessed value, annual taxes would be around $4,000. I can look up the exact amount for any specific property.",

### Q: Will my taxes go up after I buy?

**A:** They might, but probably not dramatically. When you buy, the property's Limited Property Value resets closer to the purchase price over time. However, Proposition 117 still protects you—your LPV can only increase 5% per year maximum. If the previous owner had an artificially low LPV from years of ownership, you may see gradual increases until it catches up. Always ask to see the current tax bill before buying.

```json
{
  "topic": "Property Tax",
  "question": "Will taxes go up after I buy?",
  "answer": "Possibly, but gradually. If the seller owned the home for many years with a low Limited Property Value, it may need to catch up toward market value. But Proposition 117 still limits increases to 5% per year. Check the current tax bill—if the LPV is close to purchase price, taxes should stay stable.",

### Q: What's the difference between assessed value and market value?

**A:** Market value (Full Cash Value) is what your home could sell for. Assessed value is a percentage of that—for residential properties in Arizona, it's 10% of the Limited Property Value. So a $400,000 home would have an assessed value around $40,000. Your taxes are calculated on this assessed value, not the full market value.

```json
{
  "topic": "Property Tax",
  "question": "What's the difference between assessed value and market value?",
  "answer": "Market value is what your home would sell for. Assessed value is just 10% of your Limited Property Value—that's what taxes are actually calculated on. So a $400,000 home has about a $40,000 assessed value. This is standard in Arizona.",

## How to Calculate Arizona Property Tax

### Calculation Example

**Property:** Single-family home  
**Full Cash Value:** $450,000  
**Limited Property Value:** $400,000 (due to Prop 117 cap)  
**Assessment Ratio:** 10%  
**Assessed Value:** $40,000

| Tax Type | Rate per $100 | Tax Amount |
|----------|---------------|------------|
| County Primary | $0.85 | $340 |
| School District | $3.50 | $1,400 |
| City Primary | $1.20 | $480 |
| Fire District | $2.00 | $800 |
| CFD Bond (Secondary) | $1.50 | $600 |
| **Total Annual Taxes** | | **$3,620** |

```json
{
  "topic": "Property Tax",
  "question": "How do I calculate Arizona property taxes?",
  "answer": "Take your Limited Property Value, multiply by 10% to get your assessed value. Then multiply by your combined tax rate. For example, a $400,000 LPV equals $40,000 assessed value. At a $9 per $100 rate, that's about $3,600 per year in taxes.",

## Special Districts and Assessments

### Q: What is a Community Facilities District (CFD)?

**A:** A CFD is a special taxing district created to fund infrastructure for new developments—like roads, parks, schools, or water systems. If a property is in a CFD, you'll pay an additional tax to repay those bonds. This shows up as a secondary tax on your bill. CFD taxes can range from $500 to $3,000+ annually depending on the district and remaining bond balance.

```json
{
  "topic": "Property Tax",
  "question": "What is a CFD?",
  "answer": "A CFD, or Community Facilities District, is a special tax for infrastructure in newer communities—things like roads, parks, and schools. It's an extra tax on top of regular property taxes, typically $500 to $3,000 per year. It's important to check if a property has CFD taxes before buying.",

}
```

### Q: What is an Improvement District assessment?

**A:** Improvement Districts fund specific local improvements like paved roads, streetlights, water/sewer lines, or drainage systems. Unlike CFDs, these assessments are often per-parcel rather than based on property value. They appear as line items on your tax bill and typically have a defined payoff period—often 10-20 years.

```json
{
  "topic": "Property Tax",
  "question": "What is an Improvement District?",
  "answer": "An Improvement District funds local infrastructure like roads, water lines, or streetlights. It's usually a fixed annual amount per property—maybe $200 to $800 per year—and pays off over 10 to 20 years. Check the tax bill for any improvement district assessments.",

  "last_updated": "2026-01",

}
```

### Q: What are fire district taxes?

**A:** Fire district taxes fund local fire protection and emergency services in areas outside city limits. If you're in an unincorporated area or rural community, you'll likely have a fire district tax. Rates vary by district—typically $1 to $3 per $100 of assessed value. Properties within city limits usually don't have separate fire district taxes since fire service is included in city taxes.

```json
{
  "topic": "Property Tax",
  "question": "What are fire district taxes?",
  "answer": "Fire district taxes fund fire protection and emergency services in areas outside city limits. If you're in an unincorporated or rural area, expect to pay a fire district tax—usually $1 to $3 per $100 of assessed value. Properties in cities typically get fire service through city taxes instead.",
  "source": "County Assessor Records",
  "last_updated": "2026-01",
  "voice_ready": true
}
```

### Q: How do I know if a property has special assessments?

**A:** Always request a full tax statement from the County Treasurer or look it up online. The tax bill will itemize all special districts—CFDs, improvement districts, fire districts, and any other assessments. Also check the title report during escrow—it will list any recorded assessment liens.

```json
{
  "topic": "Property Tax",
  "question": "How do I find out about special assessments?",
  "answer": "Check the property's tax bill from the County Treasurer—it lists every district and assessment. You can look this up online with the parcel number. During escrow, the title report will also show any assessment liens. Always verify before closing.",

## Exemptions and Relief Programs

### Q: Is there a primary residence exemption in Arizona?

## Appeals and Disputes

### Q: Can I appeal my property's assessed value?

**A:** Absolutely. If you believe your property's Full Cash Value is too high, you can file an appeal with the County Assessor. The deadline is typically 60 days after mailed notice (usually late April). Bring evidence like comparable sales, an appraisal, or documentation of property issues. If the Assessor doesn't adjust, you can escalate to the State Board of Equalization.

```json
{
  "topic": "Property Tax",
  "question": "Can I appeal my property taxes?",
  "answer": "Yes, you can appeal if you think your property is overvalued. File with your County Assessor within 60 days of receiving your notice—usually by late April.
