## SECTION 1: WATER RIGHTS FUNDAMENTALS

### Q: What are Arizona's Active Management Areas and why do they matter?

**A (2-3 sentences, voice-friendly):** Arizona has seven Active Management Areas—Phoenix, Tucson, Pinal, Prescott, Santa Cruz, Douglas, and Willcox Basin—where groundwater is strictly regulated because aquifers were being depleted. If your property is in an AMA, developers had to prove a 100-year water supply before subdivisions could be built. Outside AMAs, rules are looser but still require some water disclosure.

---

### Q: What's the difference between Assured and Adequate Water Supply?

**A (2-3 sentences, voice-friendly):** Assured Water Supply means a developer in an AMA proved to the state that water will physically, legally, and continuously exist for 100 years—this is required for most new subdivisions. Adequate Water Supply is a weaker standard used outside AMAs; the developer just has to notify buyers they investigated it. Properties with Assured Water Supply certificates are generally lower-risk for buyers.

---

### Q: Does this property have water rights?

**A (2-3 sentences, voice-friendly):** Water rights in Arizona can be complex—they're not automatic with land ownership. The property may have surface water rights, grandfathered groundwater rights, or rely on a municipal system. The seller's disclosure statement should list any rights. To confirm, you can request ADWR records or contact the Arizona Department of Water Resources directly.

---

### Q: What happens if a property has NO Assured Water Supply?

**A (2-3 sentences, voice-friendly):** It may be in a rural area or a small subdivision that doesn't require certification. This isn't automatically a problem, but the seller must disclose any known water issues like past curtailments or low well yields. We recommend you investigate the water provider directly and have a well inspector confirm status if it's a well-dependent property.

---

## SECTION 2: WATER SOURCE TYPES

### Q: What's the difference between city water and well water?

**A (2-3 sentences, voice-friendly):** City water is delivered by municipalities or regulated private companies through pipes and is inspected by the state. Well water is pumped from underground on or near your property, and you're responsible for maintenance, testing, and quality. Wells give you independence but require more upkeep; city water is regulated but may face rate increases or drought cutoffs.

---

### Q: The SPDS says the property has "hauled water." What does that mean?

**A (2-3 sentences, voice-friendly):** Hauled water means a truck delivers water to a storage tank on the property—common in rural Arizona where municipal service or wells aren't available. Monthly costs can be significant, and supply may be interrupted during droughts. Ask the seller about typical costs and reliability, and verify if any water rights exist for future well drilling.

---

### Q: How do I find out which water company serves this property?

**A (2-3 sentences, voice-friendly):** Check the Seller's Property Disclosure Statement—it should list the water provider's name. You can also verify with the Arizona Corporation Commission's water utility list or contact the local city/county planning office. If it's a well, ask the seller for ADWR well registration records showing the owner and permit status.

---

### Q: What's a private water company, and are they reliable?

**A (2-3 sentences, voice-friendly):** Private water companies serve some Arizona neighborhoods and are regulated by the Arizona Corporation Commission. They may be smaller or newer than municipal systems. You can check the ACC website to see if the company has an Assured Water Supply designation—if yes, it's been vetted to provide 100 years of sustainable water. Ask about rate history and any past service interruptions.

---

## SECTION 3: DOMESTIC WELLS

### Q: If the property has a well, what documents must I get?

**A (2-3 sentences, voice-friendly):** Arizona law requires the seller to provide a Domestic Water Well Addendum, which details the well's age, depth, capacity, condition, and any past failures. Request ADWR well registration records, any well inspection reports, and maintenance history. If the well is shared with neighbors, get a copy of the well-use agreement—it defines rights and costs.

---

### Q: What's a flow test, and why is it important for wells?

**A (2-3 sentences, voice-friendly):** A flow test measures how many gallons per minute a well can produce and how quickly it recharges. Low flow or slow recharge means water may run out during high-use periods or drought. Ask the seller for recent test results; if none exist or results are poor, hire a licensed well inspector to test during your due diligence period.

---

### Q: The well is listed as being in an Active Management Area. Should I be concerned?

**A (2-3 sentences, voice-friendly):** AMAs have stricter groundwater regulations, but that's not inherently bad—it means the state monitors and protects water. However, AMAs like Pinal and parts of Phoenix face groundwater stress. Check if the well is shallow or deep, verify the AMA's management plan and any restrictions on new wells, and ask the ADWR if the well is in a declining aquifer zone.

---

### Q: What if the well is shared with neighbors?

**A (2-3 sentences, voice-friendly):** A shared well means multiple properties pump from one system—costs and maintenance are split, and one owner's problems affect everyone. You need a recorded well-use agreement that defines each person's rights, maintenance obligations, and dispute resolution. Get a copy from the seller, verify all parties comply, and clarify who repairs the pump if it fails.

---

## SECTION 4: WATER RIGHTS & CERTIFICATES

### Q: What's a Certificate of Assured Water Supply, and does this property have one?

**A (2-3 sentences, voice-friendly):** A Certificate of Assured Water Supply is a state approval proving that a subdivision in an AMA has adequate water for 100 years. It's required for developments of six or more lots. You can check the ADWR online database or ask the seller—if the property is in a qualifying subdivision but has no certificate, that's a red flag requiring investigation.

---

### Q: What are grandfathered water rights?

**A (2-3 sentences, voice-friendly):** Grandfathered water rights are legal claims to groundwater established before the 1980 Groundwater Management Act. They're based on historical use and are preserved for current property owners. The SPDS should note if the property has these rights and what type (Type I, Type II, or Irrigation). Verify with ADWR records to confirm the extent of rights.

---

### Q: What's a surface water right, and how is it different from groundwater?

**A (2-3 sentences, voice-friendly):** Surface water rights are claims to river or stream water and are recorded as certificates with ADWR. Groundwater rights are claims to underground aquifer water. Surface water is from Colorado River or other rivers and may be more stable; groundwater faces depletion concerns in some areas. Ask if the property has either type—surface rights are valuable.

---

### Q: The SPDS lists a "Certificate of Groundwater Use." What does that mean?

**A (2-3 sentences, voice-friendly):** A Certificate of Groundwater Use proves the property owner has registered their well with ADWR and established a legal right to pump a certain amount of groundwater. It's required for all wells in Arizona. If the property has this certificate, it means the well is legal and registered. If not, that's a compliance issue.

---

## SECTION 5: ACTIVE MANAGEMENT AREAS (AMA-SPECIFIC)

### Q: Which Active Management Area is this property in?

**A (2-3 sentences, voice-friendly):** Arizona has seven AMAs with different regulations. Phoenix AMA (includes much of metro Phoenix) aims for safe yield. Pinal AMA (central Arizona) balances agriculture and new development. Santa Cruz, Tucson, Prescott, Douglas, and Willcox Basin have additional rules. Check the Seller's Disclosure or ADWR map to confirm your property's AMA status.

---

### Q: What does "safe yield" mean for an AMA?

**A (2-3 sentences, voice-friendly):** Safe yield means the AMA withdraws only as much groundwater as is naturally replenished each year—so the aquifer doesn't decline. Phoenix, Tucson, and Prescott AMAs target safe yield by 2025. If your property is in one of these AMAs, it means the state has required strict water management. Verify the water provider's plan to achieve this goal.

---

### Q: What's different about the Pinal AMA?

**A (2-3 sentences, voice-friendly):** Pinal AMA has a unique goal: preserve existing agriculture while allowing new residential and commercial development. This balancing act creates complexity because agricultural water is being redirected to cities. Pinal faces a projected groundwater deficit in 100 years, so new developments there face stricter requirements and costs. If buying in Pinal, investigate water security carefully.

---

### Q: Are there water restrictions in my area?

**A (2-3 sentences, voice-friendly):** Depends on your AMA and provider. In Phoenix and Tucson AMAs, municipal providers must meet conservation standards. In Pinal, agricultural use may be restricted. Outside AMAs, fewer restrictions exist. Check your water provider's conservation requirements and ask if any moratoriums or growth limitations apply to your property.

---

### Q: What if my property is outside an AMA?

**A (2-3 sentences, voice-friendly):** Outside AMAs, the Adequate Water Supply standard applies—less stringent than Assured. Developers must notify buyers they investigated water availability but don't have to prove 100 years. You have more responsibility to verify water status. Check well depth, ADWR records, and local groundwater conditions, as some rural areas face overuse despite lacking AMA regulation.

---

## SECTION 6: WILDCAT SUBDIVISIONS & EXEMPTIONS

### Q: What's a "wildcat subdivision," and is it a problem?

**A (2-3 sentences, voice-friendly):** A wildcat subdivision is land split into five or fewer parcels to avoid the state's requirement to prove a 100-year water supply. The seller still must disclose known water problems, but there's no independent state verification of long-term availability. These subdivisions carry higher risk—you must investigate water status thoroughly and consider the possibility of future constraints.

---

### Q: Why is the five-lot exemption important?

**A (2-3 sentences, voice-friendly):** Arizona law exempts subdivisions of five or fewer lots from needing a Certificate of Assured Water Supply. Developers use this loophole to avoid costly water studies. Buyer beware: these properties don't have state-verified 100-year water security. Always investigate water source, well status, and any history of supply problems in such areas.

---

### Q: What should I specifically investigate in a wildcat area?

**A (2-3 sentences, voice-friendly):** Check the well's depth and registration with ADWR—if it's shallow or in a declining aquifer zone, there's risk. Ask neighbors about their water experience and any past cutoffs. Request a well flow test and water quality analysis. Get quotes for hauled water as a backup. Buy contingent on well inspection approval.

---

### Q: Has the state fixed the wildcat loophole?

**A (2-3 sentences, voice-friendly):** As of early 2026, the Arizona legislature is debating reforms after the Rio Verde Foothills water crisis (residents lost service in 2023). Governor Katie Hobbs has pushed for stricter rules, but home builders are resisting. For now, the exemption remains. Buy in wildcat areas at your own risk, but demand thorough water due diligence.

---

## SECTION 7: ADWR DISCLOSURES & COMPLIANCE

### Q: What must the seller disclose about water?

**A (2-3 sentences, voice-friendly):** Arizona law requires the seller to disclose the property's water source (municipal, private company, well, shared well, or hauled water), any known drinking water problems, and whether the property is in an AMA or affected by water programs like CAGRD. If the property has a well, the seller must provide a Domestic Water Well Addendum. Nondisclosure can be treated as fraud.

---

### Q: What's a Seller's Property Disclosure Statement (SPDS), and what does it cover on water?

**A (2-3 sentences, voice-friendly):** The SPDS is a legal form the seller completes detailing known property conditions. For water, it asks: source type, any past or present drinking water problems, AMA status, grandfathered water rights, and surface water rights. Review it carefully—seller misstatements are legally actionable. If the seller doesn't provide one, request it before signing; you have a legal right to know material facts.

---

### Q: What's a Domestic Water Well Addendum?

**A (2-3 sentences, voice-friendly):** This Arizona REALTORS form provides detailed well information: registration with ADWR, location (on or off property), AMA status, depth, age, pump/tank condition, flow test results, water quality history, and whether the well has ever failed. Seller must complete it within five days of contract and provide copies to you and the escrow company. It's your main source of well details.

---

### Q: If water adequacy isn't determined by ADWR, what does that mean?

**A (2-3 sentences, voice-friendly):** It means ADWR hasn't formally approved the water supply for the property. This often occurs for wells, private water companies, or municipal providers serving outside their designated service area. The SPDS will note this, and it means you must contact the water provider directly to verify they can supply your home reliably.

---

## SECTION 8: GROUNDWATER PROGRAMS & FEES

### Q: What's CAGRD, and will I pay fees?

**A (2-3 sentences, voice-friendly):** CAGRD is the Central Arizona Groundwater Replenishment District—a state program that replenishes groundwater in Phoenix and Tucson AMAs to offset new groundwater pumping and prevent aquifer depletion. If your property is in a CAGRD member area, you'll pay annual assessment fees (appears on your property tax bill) based on groundwater use. Check with your water provider or county assessor for fee amounts.

---

### Q: What are adjudications, and do they affect my water rights?

**A (2-3 sentences, voice-friendly):** Arizona is conducting court proceedings (adjudications) to determine who has rights to water in major river systems like the San Pedro and Gila Rivers. If your property is near an adjudication basin, future water availability or your rights might change as the court decides claims. Check ADWR's adjudications page to see if your watershed is involved.

---

### Q: What's the Alternative Designation of Assured Water Supply (ADAWS)?

**A (2-3 sentences, voice-friendly):** ADAWS is a newer state program (emerging 2024–2026) allowing water providers to secure 100-year water designations by combining renewable water supplies (CAP, reclaimed) with sustainable groundwater. It's a response to Pinal and Phoenix groundwater stress. If your subdivision uses ADAWS, it means water security is achieved through a combination of sources rather than groundwater alone—generally a positive sign.

---

## SECTION 9: BUYER DUE DILIGENCE

### Q: How do I verify a property's water status?

**A (2-3 sentences, voice-friendly):** Start by reviewing the Seller's Property Disclosure and any Public Report. Request ADWR well registration and water rights certificates. Contact the water provider to confirm service and any water supply designations. If the property has a well, hire a licensed well inspector for flow and quality testing. Check the county tax bill for CAGRD fees. Consult ADWR maps for AMA status and adjudication impacts.

---

### Q: What's a Public Report, and where do I find it?

**A (2-3 sentences, voice-friendly):** A Public Report is an Arizona Department of Real Estate document required for subdivisions of six or more lots. It includes water supply information, developer details, and CC&Rs. You can search for free on the ADRE Public Report Database online. It's a snapshot from development time, so verify current conditions with the water provider—some reports may be decades old.

---

### Q: Should I hire a professional to inspect the well?

**A (2-3 sentences, voice-friendly):** Absolutely, if the property relies on a well. Hire a licensed well inspector (not a well driller) to test water flow, recharge rate, quality (bacteria, minerals, chemicals), and pump/tank condition. This is standard for FHA loans. Cost ranges from $200–$500 but could save you from buying a property with a failing well. Do this during your inspection period contingency.

---

### Q: What questions should I ask my water provider?

**A (2-3 sentences, voice-friendly):** Ask: Does your company have an Assured or Adequate Water Supply designation? What's your water source (CAP, groundwater, surface water, reclaimed)? Are there any moratoriums or growth restrictions? What's the rate trend? Any past service interruptions? For groundwater providers, ask if they're in a declining aquifer zone. Take notes—provider responses may reveal risks the seller didn't mention.

---

## SECTION 10: RED FLAGS & RISK SCENARIOS

### Q: Red flag—the property is in a wildcat subdivision with a well. Should I be concerned?

**A (2-3 sentences, voice-friendly):** Yes, this combines two risk factors: no state verification of 100-year water security, plus dependence on a private well with no mandatory AMA oversight. Investigate the well's depth, age, and yield carefully. Ask neighbors about past water issues. Consider getting a geological study of the aquifer. Buy only if well testing shows strong, consistent flow and good water quality.

---

### Q: Red flag—seller won't provide well documents or ADWR records.

**A (2-3 sentences, voice-friendly):** This is a major concern and may indicate problems the seller is hiding. Legally, seller must disclose known water issues. If they refuse to provide records, that itself is suspicious—it could mean the well is unregistered, failing, or has compliance issues. Make any offer contingent on obtaining full ADWR and well documentation. If seller refuses, walk away or reduce offer significantly.

---

### Q: Red flag—the property is in Pinal AMA with no CAGRD membership.

**A (2-3 sentences, voice-friendly):** Pinal faces severe groundwater deficit, and properties without CAGRD protection may be at higher long-term risk. Verify if the water provider has an Assured Water Supply designation or is part of a groundwater replenishment strategy. If relying only on declining groundwater with no state-backed sustainability plan, understand the long-term risk and potential future costs or water cuts.

---

### Q: Red flag—adjudication is pending for this watershed.

**A (2-3 sentences, voice-friendly):** Pending court decisions on water rights could affect your property's future access. While not necessarily disqualifying, it introduces uncertainty. Ask the water provider how adjudication could impact them and you. Consult a water law attorney if this is a major concern. Understand that adjudication outcomes may take years and could reshape water allocation in your area.

---

## SECTION 11: GREEN FLAGS & CONFIDENCE BUILDERS

### Q: Green flag—property served by a designated water provider with Assured Water Supply.

**A (2-3 sentences, voice-friendly):** Excellent sign. It means the provider—usually a major city like Phoenix, Tucson, Mesa, or a large private utility—has proven to ADWR it can supply 100 years of renewable water (CAP, surface water, reclaimed). This is the gold standard in Arizona. Your water security is state-verified and backed by professional management.

---

### Q: Green flag—subdivision in AMA with a valid Certificate of Assured Water Supply.

**A (2-3 sentences, voice-friendly):** This means the developer met all state requirements: legal, physical, continuous, quality, and financial standards for 100 years. ADWR reviewed and approved it. Much lower risk than unverified subdivisions. Ask if the certificate is Type A (stable conditions, easily assignable) or Type B (may require review if conditions change).

---

### Q: Green flag—well recently tested with good flow and quality results.

**A (2-3 sentences, voice-friendly):** If the seller provides recent professional flow tests (gallons per minute) and water quality lab results showing no contamination or mineral issues, the well is likely reliable. Recent tests are better than old ones. Flow above 15 GPM is good for household use; above 25 GPM is excellent. This gives you confidence the well will serve you for decades.

---

## SECTION 12: RESOURCES & REFERRALS

### Q: Where do I get more information about ADWR records?

**A (2-3 sentences, voice-friendly):** Visit ADWR.gov or call them at 602-771-8500. You can search well registrations, water rights certificates, and AMA maps on their website. Request a well report by well number or address. For Certificate of Assured Water Supply lookup, use their CAWS database. ADWR staff can answer specific questions about your property's water status.

---

### Q: What if I need a water law attorney?

**A (2-3 sentences, voice-friendly):** Contact the State Bar of Arizona to find a water law specialist. Many attorneys offer initial consultations. Water law issues—adjudications, rights disputes, endangered species impacts—are complex and worth professional guidance, especially for rural or high-value properties. Costs vary; discuss fees upfront.

---

### Q: How do I hire a qualified well inspector?

**A (2-3 sentences, voice-friendly):** Ask your real estate agent, home inspector, or county environmental office for referrals. Don't hire the well driller for inspection—they have a conflict of interest. Verify the inspector is licensed by the state, bonded, and insured. Ask about credentials and past well inspection reports they've completed. Expect to pay $200–$500 for a thorough inspection.

---

### Q: Where do I check Arizona Corporation Commission water company info?

**A (2-3 sentences, voice-friendly):** Visit azcc.gov and navigate to Utilities – Water. Search for the water company serving your property. You can see if they're regulated, if there are complaints, rate changes, or service area. If the company isn't ACC-regulated, they may be a municipal system (check city website) or a private well owner (check ADWR).

---

## SECTION 13: VOICE AGENT ESCALATION TRIGGERS

### When to Escalate to Human Agent or Legal Review

**Scenario 1: Wildcat Subdivision + Well with Unknown Yield**
Recommend buyer obtain well flow test immediately, contingent on positive results. If test shows <10 GPM or well history is unclear, escalate to agent for negotiation/walkaway decision.

**Scenario 2: Seller Refuses to Provide Well Documents**
Flag as major nondisclosure issue. Escalate to listing agent and buyer's attorney. May indicate well compliance problems or undisclosed failures.

**Scenario 3: Property in Pinal AMA + No CAGRD Membership**
Flag groundwater stress risk. Escalate for water law attorney review of long-term implications.

**Scenario 4: Adjudication Pending + Property Has Surface Water Rights**
Escalate for legal counsel to assess potential impact on rights and value.

**Scenario 5: Multiple Water Problems Disclosed (Low yield, past failures, quality issues)**
Escalate to appraisals and engineering review; may significantly impact property value and insurability.
