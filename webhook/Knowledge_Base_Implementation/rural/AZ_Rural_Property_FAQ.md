## SPUD (Subdivision Public Report)

### Q: What is a SPUD and when is it required?

**A:** A SPUD, or Subdivision Public Report, is a document from the Arizona Department of Real Estate (ADRE) that discloses material information about a subdivision with **6 or more lots**. Before any sale, the buyer must receive and acknowledge the SPUD. Properties with 5 or fewer lots are exempt—these are called "wildcat subdivisions."

### Q: What does the SPUD contain?

**A:** The SPUD includes information about:

- Water availability and source
- Road access and maintenance
- Utilities (electric, gas, phone)
- Flood zone status
- Any deed restrictions or HOA requirements
- Developer financial information

### Q: What are the buyer acknowledgment requirements?

**A:** The buyer must sign a receipt acknowledging they received the Public Report **before** signing the purchase contract. The buyer also has a **7-day right to cancel** after receiving the SPUD. Without proper SPUD delivery and acknowledgment, the sale may be voidable.

### Q: What if the property doesn't have a SPUD?

**A:** If the subdivision has fewer than 6 lots, no SPUD is required. This means the state hasn't verified water, road access, or utilities. You're responsible for your own due diligence—hire inspectors and verify everything independently.

**Voice Script:** *"This property is in a wildcat subdivision, which means there's no state-issued Public Report. You'll want to independently verify water supply, road access, and utilities before making a decision."*

## Septic Systems

### Q: Is this property on septic or sewer?

**A:** Check the Seller's Property Disclosure Statement (SPDS) and the A.R.S. § 33-422 Affidavit for unincorporated land. If it's on septic, the disclosure should include the system type, age, and last inspection date. Municipal sewer connections are typically noted in utility records.

### Q: When was the septic last inspected?

**A:** In Maricopa County, a septic inspection by a licensed contractor is **required at time of property transfer**. The seller should provide the inspection report. If it's older than 12 months, request a new inspection as part of your due diligence.

### Q: What are Maricopa County septic inspection requirements?

**A:** Maricopa County Environmental Services requires:

- Inspection by a licensed septic contractor at property transfer
- Pumping and inspection every 3-5 years (recommended)
- Permit for any septic repairs or replacements
- Contact: Maricopa County Environmental Services at 602-506-6616

### Q: What's the disclosure obligation for septic age and condition?

**A:** Sellers must disclose:

- Type of system (conventional, aerobic, sand filter)
- Age of the system (if known)
- Date of last pumping/inspection
- Any known problems or repairs
- Whether the system meets current code

### Q: What are alternative septic systems?

**A:** Common alternative systems in Arizona include:

- **Aerobic Treatment Units (ATUs):** Use oxygen to break down waste; require electricity and regular maintenance
- **Sand Filter Systems:** Filter effluent through sand before dispersal; good for poor soil conditions
- **Mound Systems:** Raised drain field for high water table areas

**Voice Script:** *"This property has an aerobic septic system. These require more maintenance than conventional systems—typically quarterly inspections and an annual service contract. Make sure you budget for that ongoing cost."*

### Q: How do I verify septic system permits?

**A:** Contact the county environmental services department:

- **Maricopa:** 602-506-6616 or [maricopa.gov/envservices](https://maricopa.gov/envservices)
- **Pinal:** 520-866-6929
- **Pima:** 520-724-7400

## Well Water

### Q: What are Arizona well registration requirements?

**A:** All domestic wells must be registered with the Arizona Department of Water Resources (ADWR). The owner should have a **Well Registration** (Form 55-55A) showing:

- Well location and depth
- Date drilled
- Pump capacity
- Water level measurements

Contact ADWR at 602-771-8500 to verify registration.

### Q: Is the well shared with neighbors?

**A:** Check the title report for recorded **Shared Well Agreements**. These documents specify:

- Which properties share the well
- Maintenance and repair responsibilities
- Cost-sharing arrangements
- Water allocation rights

Unrecorded shared well arrangements are risky—insist on a recorded agreement.

### Q: What's the water quality like?

**A:** Well water quality isn't guaranteed. Request the seller's most recent water test results. If none exist, hire a certified lab to test for:

- Bacteria (coliform, E. coli)
- Nitrates
- Arsenic (common in Arizona)
- Total dissolved solids (TDS)
- pH levels

**Voice Script:** *"The seller should provide water test results. If they don't have recent testing, I'd recommend hiring a certified lab before closing. Arsenic is common in Arizona groundwater, so that's an important one to check."*

### Q: What water quality testing is recommended?

**A:** At minimum, test for:

- **Bacteria** (coliform) — health safety
- **Nitrates** — indicates contamination
- **Arsenic** — naturally occurring in AZ
- **Hardness** — affects appliances and plumbing

Cost: $150-300 for comprehensive testing. Labs: Arizona State Lab, National Testing Labs, local certified labs.

### Q: What if the well yield is low?

**A:** Well yield under **5 gallons per minute (GPM)** may be insufficient for household use without a storage tank. Ask about:

- Was a flow test performed?
- Is there a storage tank installed?
- What's the recovery rate?

Low-yield wells often require 1,500-2,500 gallon storage tanks to buffer supply.

## Common Buyer Questions (Voice-Ready)

### Q: What utilities does this rural property have?

**A:** Rural properties may lack municipal utilities. Verify:

- **Electric:** Contact APS or local cooperative
- **Gas:** Propane tank vs. natural gas line
- **Phone/Internet:** May be limited to satellite
- **Water:** Well, hauled, or water company
- **Sewer:** Septic system

### Q: Are there road maintenance responsibilities?

**A:** If the property is on a private road, you're responsible for maintenance. Check for:

- Recorded road maintenance agreement
- Cost-sharing with neighbors
- Current road condition
- County acceptance status

**Voice Script:** *"The road to this property is privately maintained. There's a recorded maintenance agreement where you'd share costs with five other property owners. The current annual assessment is about $500."*

### Q: What's a wildcat subdivision?

**A:** A wildcat subdivision is a development of **5 or fewer lots** that's exempt from ADRE Public Report requirements. The state hasn't verified water, road access, or utilities. Buyers must do their own due diligence—there's no safety net.

### Q: Is there legal access to this property?

**A:** Legal access means you have a recorded right to reach the property from a public road. Check the title report for:

- Recorded access easements
- Road right-of-way
- Landlocked status (red flag!)

Physical access doesn't equal legal access. An attorney should review easement documents.

## Red Flags for Rural Properties

### Immediate Concerns

- No recorded access easement → may be landlocked
- Septic inspection older than 5 years → may need replacement
- Well yield under 2 GPM → likely insufficient
- No SPUD for 6+ lot subdivision → regulatory violation
- Unrecorded shared well agreement → future disputes

### Questions to Always Ask

1. Who maintains the road?
2. When was the septic last pumped?
3. Is the well registered with ADWR?
4. Has the water been tested recently?
5. Are there any pending assessments?

## Implementation Notes

### RAG Retrieval Pattern

```python
@app.post("/rural_property_qa")
async def rural_qa(payload: dict):
    query = payload["question"]
    property_type = payload.get("property_type", "rural")
    
    # Route to appropriate knowledge base
    if "septic" in query.lower():
        hits = search_septic_chunks(query, top_k=3)
    elif "well" in query.lower():
        hits = search_well_chunks(query, top_k=3)
    elif "spud" in query.lower() or "subdivision" in query.lower():
        hits = search_spud_chunks(query, top_k=3)
    else:
        hits = search_rural_chunks(query, top_k=3)
    
    answer = synthesize_response(query, hits)
    return {"answer": answer, "sources": hits}
```

### Latency Budget

- Septic/well lookup: <100ms
- LLM synthesis: 200-400ms
- **Total rural Q&A:** ~300-500ms
