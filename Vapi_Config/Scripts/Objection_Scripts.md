Objection Handling Scripts for Real Estate
Pattern-Based Script Architecture
Real estate objection handling differs structurally from generic sales objections because the core pushback involves property/market uncertainty rather than vendor credibility. The most effective patterns follow a three-step response structure: acknowledge + reframe + offer specific next step.

Common Objection Scenarios & Production Scripts
Objection Underlying Concern AI Response Pattern Next Step
"I'm just browsing" Wants to avoid sales pressure "Totally get it—most people start there. A quick conversation helps you know what's realistic in your price range and timeline." Ask timeline and offer property matches
"Not ready yet" Timing mismatch "No rush at all. When are you thinking about moving?" [Pause] "Okay, I'll make a note. If you're open to it, we can check back in March with updated listings." Schedule 30/60/90-day callback
"Need to talk to spouse/partner" Authority issue "Smart move. Happy to schedule a call when they're available, or I can send over a summary they can review. Which works better?" Joint callback or async follow-up
"Had bad experience with agents" Trust/competency doubt "I hear that. What went wrong?" [Listen] "That's frustrating. Here's what's different about how we work..." [Specific differentiator] Offer low-risk next step (property info, not hard commitment)
"Property no longer available" Deal killed "Got it—was it sold recently?" [If yes] "Congrats to them! Mind if I ask what price?" [Gather intelligence] "I've got three similar properties you might like..." Redirect to alternatives
