Results:

Scheduling efficiency improvement: +60%

Appointment booking increase: +2.5x

Cost per booking reduction: -70%

Booking cost: Fell from ~$25-30 per appointment to ~$7-10

Translation to Real Estate: Similar metrics achievable:

Appointment booking cost (showing scheduling): ~$5-15 per scheduled showing (vs. human scheduling cost of $25-50)

Missed appointment rate (with SMS reminders): <20% (vs. 30-40% without automation)

Show-up confirmation rate: 85-90% (vs. 70-75% without reminders)
