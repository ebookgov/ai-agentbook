Case Study 1: $70K/Month Real Estate Lead Qualification (2025)
Implementation: ElevenLabs voice agent (cloned agent voice) + Make.com automations for calendar/CRM

Scale: Single real estate professional with 100-200 inbound leads monthly

Workflow:

Lead submits contact form (budget, timeline, property type, location)

AI voice agent calls lead within 1-2 minutes (speed-to-lead advantage)

Agent qualifies BANT, determines fit (pre-approval status, possession timeline)

If qualified: Books showing, sends property details SMS

Make.com automation updates CRM, sends agent notification

Results:

Qualified leads per month: ~50-60 (from 100-200 inbound)

Showings scheduled by AI: 40-45 per month

Commission average: $5,000-7,000 per deal

Estimated monthly revenue from AI-qualified leads: $70,000

AI platform cost: ~$2,000/month (ElevenLabs + Make)

ROI: 35x first year (assuming 10-15 deals close from AI qualification)
​

Key Insight: The breakthrough was qualification specificity (pre-approval + possession timeline + property type), not just volume. AI eliminated 70% of unqualified prospects upfront, allowing the agent to focus on 40-50 genuinely hot leads monthly.
